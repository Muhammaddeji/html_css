        <h1> Solar System </h1> 

        <h2> Neptune </h2>

        <p> Neptune is one of the solar system and by far the farthest from the sun in our solae system. It's an ice giant, composed maily
            ammonia, and methane ices. The planet is known for having some of the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching up to 2,100 km/h,
            making its storms quiet intense. Neptune has a fascinating system of moons and rings. </p>

        <h3> Mars </h3>

        <p> Mars, often called the red planet, is the planet from the sun in our solar system. It is known for its 
            reddish appearance due to iron oxide in the soil. Mrars has captivated human interest for centuries.
            Today, Mars is a focus of scientific research explorration, with rovers like NASA's perseverance studying
            its geology and searching igns of past life. </p>

        <h4> Mercury </h4>

        <p>  Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the sun. With a highly elliptical orbit, mercury experiences extreme temperature
            fluctuations, raging from scorching highs to freezing lows. Its surface is heavily crated, indicating a geologically inactive surface. Despite its small 
            size and challenging environment, mercury remains an intriguing subject for scientists studying planetary formation and the effects of slar proximity on 
            celestial body</p>

        <h5> Jupiter </h5>

        <p> Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant known for its massive size and stormy atmosphere. Its distinctive feature is the Great Red spot, 
            a centuries-old persistent storm. Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and its rapid rotation creates strong winds and vibrant cloud bands.
            As a gas giant, Jupiter plays a crucial role in shaping the slar system's structure and protecting inner planets from asteriods and comets.</p>

        <h6> Earth </h6>
        <p> Earth is also a planet from the sun and the only known planet to support life. With a diverse range of ecosystems, from oceans to forest and deserts, Earth provides a unique 
            environment for a vast array of plant and animal species. The planet's atmosphere is composed of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases. Earth's surface is 71% water, with vast oceans playing a crucial 
            role in wheather patterns and climate regulation. </p>
